\textbf{Overview of the \textsc{Roundtable Policy} pipeline.} 
Multiple LLMs (\emph{players}) first generate candidate responses, which are evaluated by an ensemble of graders (\emph{AI Committee}) to construct a confidence-weight table. At inference, a \emph{Fusion Agent} produces a consensus-weighted answer guided by this table. Illustrative demonstrations for both MultiTask (Figure~\ref{fig:multitask_demo}) and SingleTask (Figure~\ref{fig:singletask_demo}) settings are provided in Appendix~\S\ref{app:detailed_demo}.}
